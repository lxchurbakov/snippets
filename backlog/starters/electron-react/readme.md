# Electron React Starter

Simple application with Electron. To run the "frontend" part use `npm run dev`. The rest (`make`, `start` and `package`) are from `electron-forge`. If parcel complains for `main` being invalid in the `package.json` you can just remove this line from `package.json`. You will need to put it back when doing `npm start` / `npm make`.
